# Scratch-Crypto
This is a repository for all the code I've written on Scratch for my various projects on Cryptography, including those that aren't allowed on the Scratch platform due to hacking potential. I decided to upload them here to share my work for educational purposes.

While they are licensed under CC-BY-NC-ND here, the projects that aren't usable for attack purposes are shared and licensed under CC-BY-SA on the Scratch platform, and accessible [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Qu1ck5h0t/). Hence, the only projects that aren't remixable are those that have the potential for malicious use, and this is done for safety purposes. 

The reason why I decided to still share the projects inaccessible on Scratch here under a noderivatives license is so that people with legitimate interests in cryptanalysis, such as researchers and students such as myself may learn from or be inspired by my approach of implementing what's commonly handled by libraries and functions in Scratch's barebones logic.

In the future, the projects will be directly accessible on my website through HTML wrapping, which I will update here.
